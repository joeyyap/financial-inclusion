  Two specially trained nurses recorded                                    
  physical measurements of health for household members.  The              
  heath workers (usually newly trained nurses) visited each                
  household (often multiple times) to record various measures of           
  physical health for each household member.  The health workers           
  received special training in taking the measurements, which              
  included height, weight and head circumference (all members),            
  waist and hip circumference (members 40 years and older),                
  blood pressure and pulse (members 15 and older), lung capacity           
  (members 9 and older), and hemoglobin (members 1 year and                
  older).  In addition, respondents 15 and older were timed                
  while they rose from a sitting to a standing position five               
  times (nurses brought plastic stools for the respondents to              
  sit on).  The nurses also assessed each respondent's health              
  status on a nine-point scale.  In addition to individual                 
  measurements, the iodine content of the household's salt was             
  tested.  The head, waist and hip circumferences are new to               
  IFLS5.  The latter two help to measure body fat content, which           
  conditional on BMI, can be used to indicate risk of chronic              
  health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and               
  generally cardiovascular diseases among the older population.            


  To link records across waves of the IFLS, use PIDLINK.  It is                 
  a unique person identifier which is the same in IFLS1, 2, 2+, 3,              
  4, and 5 for a particular individual.  It may also be used to                 
  link records within IFLS5, except that as is described in                     
  Volume 2 of the User's Guide, a person if they moved                          
  households since IFLS1 may be found in multiple households                    
  with PIDLINK.  However there will be only 1 household in                      
  which the respondent currently resides, which can be found by                 
  examining variable ar01a in Book K, which is equal to 1 or 5 if               
  the respondent is a resident.                                                 

  PIDLINK is a string variable comprising 9 digits.  For a                      
  respondent in IFLS1, 2, 2+, or 3. PIDLINK is made up of HHID for              
  the wave in which they were first found, followed by 00 and                   
  then the person identifier, PID, for that wave of IFLS.  For                  
  a new respondent in IFLS5, PIDLINK is made up of HHID14 and                   
  PID14.                                                                        


  In IFLS5, HHID14 is a seven digit character variable whose digits carry       
  the following meaning:                                                        

                  x  x  x           x  x                    x  x

  In the last two digits, 00 designates an origin household.  For a split-off   
  household, the 6th digit is either 1, 2, 3 or 4 depending on which wave the   
  split-off first appeared.  Split-offs from IFLS2 have their sixth digit equal 
  to 1, while split-off households first appearing in IFLS2+ have a 2, new

  split-offs in 2000 have a 3, and new 2007 split-off have a 4.  The 7th digit  
  indicates whether it is the first, second, or other split-off (some multiple  
  split-offs occurred).                                                         

  Note that the enumeration area identifier used to define a               
  household contains no information about the current whereabouts          
  of the household unless it has not moved.  The location of the           
  household is recorded in BK_SC.

US00A              As we have informed you earlier,

                   Variable US00A can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears  
                   in this public use file.  For example, if the interviewee selected responses 
                   A, C, and F from the list, US00A will have the value ACF.  If the       
                   interviewee selected D and E, US00A will have the value DE.  Use the key

US18C              Does [HHM NAME] have physical disability

                   Variable US18C can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears  
                   in this public use file.  For example, if the interviewee selected responses 
                   A, C, and F from the list, US18C will have the value ACF.  If the       
                   interviewee selected D and E, US18C will have the value DE.  Use the key
