  The TRACKING FILES, HTRACK and PTRACK, are provided to facilitate      
  using the longitudinal dimensions of the survey.  All variables        
  included in these files are drawn from interviews conducted in         
  IFLS1 (1993), IFLS2 (1997/8), IFLS2+ (1998), IFLS3 (2000), IFLS4       
  (2007), and IFLS5 (2014).                                              


HOUSEHOLD TRACKING FILE                                                  
-----------------------                                                  
  HTRACK14 contains a list of all HOUSEHOLDS that were interviewed in      
  any wave of IFLS; they are identified by the 2014 HOUSEHOLD identifier,  
  HHID14.  It is a 7 digit string variable.  The first 3 digits are        
  the enumeration area in which the household resided in 1993 and          
  the next two digits are a household sequence number within that          
  enumeration area which uniquely identifies the household.  The           
  last two digits are always '00'.  (The first 5 digits of HHID93          
  are the same as the last 5 digits of CASE, the HH identifier             
  variable in the original IFLS1 release.)                                 

  In IFLS5, households are identified by HHID14.  If an IFLS               
  household was found intact in 2014, it was assigned the same             
  identifier as in 1993, 1997 and 2000; in this case                       
  HHID93=HHID97=HHID00=HHID07.  If the household had split up since        
  1993, then part of that household was designated the                     
  'original' household and the prior household identifier                  
  assigned to it (see Volume 2 of the User's Guide for the                 
  rules).   Each additional household that was spawned by that             
  HHID93 was given a new HHID in the wave in which it was found.           
  The first 5 digits of the new HHID are identical to the first            
  5 digits of HHID93 (and, therefore, all new households that              
  are spawned by one 1993 household share the same first 5                 
  digits in their HHIDs).  The last two digits of HHID14 are a             
  1, 2, 3 or 4 (in column 6) and then a sequence number starting at        
  1 (in the 7th column).  The digit in column 6 tells us in                
  which wave of IFLS the split-off was first found; for                    
  split-off households first found in IFLS2 the digit is a '1',            
  for split-off households found first in IFLS2+ a '2', for                
  split-off households first found in 2000 a '3', and for 2007             
  split-off households the digit is a 4.  The 7th                          
  column is the order of new split-offs found, if there are                
  multiple splits found within a wave.                                     

  Thus the last two digits of HHID14 are '00' for the household            
  retaining the original 93 HHID and then '51' for the first new           
  IFLS5 split-off, '52' for the second new IFLS5 split-off, and            
  so on.                                                                   

  For example, say HHID93 is 2071900.  This is household 19 from           
  enumeration area 214.  The household stayed intact through               
  IFLS2+, but split into 3 households between 1998 and 2000.               
  The three households are assigned HHID00 2071900 (for the                
  first of the three HHs found), 2071931 (for the first                    
  split-off HH that was found) and 2071932 (for the second                 
  split-off HH that was found).

Location of HH

  Note that the enumeration area in 1993 (digits 1-3) in the HHID          
  is not the location of residence of the household in 2000 (unless        
  the household has not moved) and should not be used to determine         
  geographic location of the household.  1993 location was built           
  into the 1993 HH identifier, CASE.  It is not built into HHID93,         
  HHID97 or HHID00.                                                        

  Location information is recorded in module BK_SC in each wave            
  of the survey.  A summary is included in HTRACK14.  HTRACK14             
  also provides information on the household's location in 1993,           
  1997, 1998, 2000, 2007. and 2014, if it was found.  For 1993, three sets of     
  location codes are given:  those used by the Central Bureau of           
  Statistics (BPS) in 1993 (also in the original IFLS1 data),              
  and those used by BPS in 1998 (in the IFLS2 data) and those              
  used by BPS in 1999.   For 1997 locations, two sets of codes             
  are given: those based on 1998 BPS codes and those based on              
  1999 codes.  For 2000 locations we also provide two sets of              
  codes.  We use the 1999 BPS codes as the main set, and these             
  are used consistently throughout IFLS5 (for example in module            
  SC of books T and K).  However, in case some users may want to           
  link IFLS5 to the February 2001 SUSENAS, so we also provide              
  the 2000 BPS codes to facilitate that linkage.  Note that                
  using the 2000 codes is more difficult because two new                   
  provinces were created from IFLS provinces in the 2000 codes:            
  West Java was split into two as was South Sumatra.  This split           
  is NOT manifested in any of the IFLS5 codes, making it easier            
  to use the 1999 BPS codes.                                               

  For households that were interviewed in IFLS5, variable                  
  MOVER14 identifies whether the household moved between the               
  last time it was interviewed (which could be 1998, 1997 or               
  1993) and 2000, taking the following values:                             

  0 = Did not move                                                         
  1 = Moved within same village/municipality                               
  2 = Moved within same kecamatan                                          
  3 = Moved within same kabupaten                                          
  4 = Moved within same province                                           
  5 = Moved within other IFLS province                                     

  MOVER14 is non-missing not only for origin households                    
  interviewed in 2014, but also for split-off households                   
  interviewed in IFLS2 through IFLS4, In addition, we calculate MOVER14    
  for new split-off households in IFLS5.  Because each split-off           
  household contains at least one person who was tracked from an           
  IFLS household (which could have been an origin household or             
  could have been a split-off), we have calculated MOVER00 for             
  split-off households on the basis of the household's 2000                
  location relative to the last known location of the household            
  from which the tracked person came. In addition to the BPS               
  location codes, HTRACK14 contains COMMID93, COMMID97 and                 
  COMMID00, which can be used to link households to the IFLS               
  community-level data.  COMMID, described in detail above, is a           
                                                                   17:02 Tuesday, April 10, 2018   4

  four digit/character code. The first two digits represent the            
  province, the third the district within province and the                 
  fourth the sub-district within district.  All households found           
  in a particular wave have non-missing COMMID for that wave,              
  even if they are movers.  COMMIDs for movers tend to have                
  letters as their third or fourth characters.  COMMID is                  
  defined at the level of the sub-district for mover households.           
  For stayers, COMMID is defined at the enumeration area, except           
  for the nine twin EAs, for whom their EAs are combined into              
  one COMMID.  This will allow users to estimate models with               
  COMMID fixed effects, for example. However for movers outside            
  of the IFLS EAs, COMMID14 is not of help in linking to                   
  community data.  MKID14 must be used instead to link to                  
  Mini-CFS, because it is defined at the EA-level for movers,              
  not at the sub-district level.  MKID14 is a five digit or                
  character code, which contains COMMID14 as the first four                
  characters, followed by a number or letter signifying EA                 
  within sub-district.  Non-movers have a 0 as the fifth digit,            
  whereas movers have a non-zero number or a letter.  MKID14               
  should be used to match mover households to their Mini-CFS               
  data files. HTRACK14 also contains household weight variables,           
  discussed in Volume 2 of the User's Guide, for IFLS1, 2 and 3,           
  both cross-section and longitudinal weights.

  PTRACK14 contains a record for every person who has ever                 
  appeared in an IFLS1, 2 or 3 household roster.                           

  PID is a two digit sequence number identifying each individual           
  within a household.  The combination of HHID14 and PID14                 
  uniquely identifies every respondent in IFLS5.  It may be used           
  to link records within IFLS5.   If an IFLS5 respondent was               
  found in the original household, HHID14=HHID07=HHID00=HHID97=HHID93 and         
  PID07=PID00=PID97=PID93.  All new respondents since IFLS1 are            
  assigned PID97, PID98, PID00, PID07, or PID14 that begins after the highest     
  PID93 for that household.  In split-off households, PID14 was            
  assigned starting at 01 for the household head.  The                     
  combination of HHID00 and PID00 uniquely identifies every                
  respondent in IFLS4 and likewise for HHID14 and PID14 in                 
  IFLS5.                                                                   

  HHID93 and PID93 or HHID97 and PID97 or HHID00 and PID00 or HHID14 and PID14                 
  should NOT however be used to link respondents across waves of           
  IFLS. Individuals who moved out of the 1993 origin household             
  and were interviewed in a new household will have different              
  HHID and PIDs across waves.  Individuals who were new                    
  household members in 2014 will have missing HHID and PID for             
  1993, 1997, or 2000.

  individual  across waves of the IFLS, use PIDLINK. It is a               
  unique person-level identifier which is the same in IFLS1, 2,            
  2+ and 3 for  a particular individual.   Within PTRACK14, each           
  observation is identified by PIDLINK.                                    

  PTRACK14 contains a number of variables that will help                   
  establish the basic demographic composition of each IFLS wave            
  and the availability of individual-level data from each wave.            
  PTRACK14 indicates in which household each person who was ever           
  an IFLS household member was found, in each wave, HHID93, 97,            
  00; plus their person IDs (PID) with the household in each               
  wave.  Further MEMBER93-MEMBER14 indicates whether the             
  person was indeed found in that wave.                                    

  Variables indicate our best guess of each person's age at each           
  wave: AGE93-AGE14.  We also report our best guess of the           
  person's date of birth.  AGE93, AGE97, and AGE00 are taken from the      
  IFLS4 PTRACK and so represent the best guess age in 1993, 1997 and       
  2000 using information available in IFLS2 or IFLS1. AGE14 is             
  our best guess age in 2014 based on IFLS5 information.  The              
  three will not necessarily be consistent, although the                   
  algorithm that generates them is essentially the same across             
  the waves.  In theory respondents interviewed in IFLS1 should            
  have been three or four years older in 1997, depending on the            
  time of year the interview took place in each wave.  In                  
  Indonesia, as in many developing countries, however, not                 
  everyone knows his/her birthdate or age accurately.                      
  Therefore, reported birthdate and ages across waves do not               
  always match for a respondent, and there may even be                     
  discrepancies between books within a wave.  In addition to age           
  and date of birth, we report our best guess of the person's              
  sex based on IFLS5 data.  For all but a few respondents, the             
  reported sex matches across waves.  The PTRACK14 file provides           
  our best guess for sex in an attempt to resolve discrepancies.           

  PTRACK14 also reports information on marital status at each              
  wave and the survey books for which data are available from              
  each wave.  Such information allows the analyst to calculate             
  the number of observations in IFLS1, IFLS2 and IFLS3 and the number      
  of panel observations for the various survey books.                      

  PTRACK14 does not provide information on individuals'                    
  locations.  At the household level, that information is in               
  HTRACK14.  For individuals who were new household members in             
  2014 (AR01a_14 = 5), the location information in HTRACK14 for            
  1993, 1997 or 2000 is not necessarily the location where the new         
  individual resided in those years.  The individual's household           
  of residence from past waves, in PTRACK14, can be used                   
  together with the location information in HTRACK14 to obtain             
  past location, so long as the person was present in an IFLS              
  household in that particular wave.  Otherwise, to ascertain              
  where a new household member lived in the past, data from                
  module MG in book 3A should be used.                                     

  PTRACK14 also contains individual weights variables, described           
                                                                   17:02 Tuesday, April 10, 2018   6
