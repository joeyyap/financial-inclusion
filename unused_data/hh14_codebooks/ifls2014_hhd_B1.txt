  Data are available in SAS (9.2) export and STATA (8.0) formats.             
  Data and electronic documentation are available on the IFLS website.        

  The survey instrument contains multiple sections.  Where possible, sections 
  have been merged together to form a single data module.  The modules are    
  organized by level of observation.  The module names are listed below.  They
  serve as the names of the SAS and STATA data files. The codebook is also    
  organised by module.                                                        

  The modules are:

NOTES ABOUT BOOK 1                                                         
------------------                                                         

  BOOK 1 contains information on household expenditures on food and        
  non-food items.  The modules are similar to the SUSENAS short            
  consumption module.  The book also contains information on prices        
  of goods and a module about health facilities that the respondent        
  knows about.  Responses in this module were used to draw the sample      
  of health facilities enumerated in the Community and Facility Survey.    

  One member of each household is asked to complete Book 1.  This          
  person is typically the woman in charge of food preparation and          
  shopping.                                                                

  In IFLS5, HHID14 is a seven digit character variable whose digits carry       
  the following meaning:                                                        

                  x  x  x           x  x                    x  x                
                  -------    ------------------        ---------------          
                    EA       specific household        origin/split-off         

  In the last two digits, 00 designates an origin household.  For a split-off   
  household, the 6th digit is either 1, 2, 3 or 4 depending on which wave the   
  split-off first appeared.  Split-offs from IFLS2 have their sixth digit equal 
  to 1, while split-off households first appearing in IFLS2+ have a 2, new      
  split-offs in 2000 have a 3, and new 2007 split-off have a 4.  The 7th digit  
  indicates whether it is the first, second, or other split-off (some multiple  
  split-offs occurred).                                                         

  Note that the enumeration area identifier used to define a               
  household contains no information about the current whereabouts          
  of the household unless it has not moved.  The location of the           
  household is recorded in BK_SC.

CP1
ANYBODY (OTHERS) OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH PRESENT DURING LAST INTERVIEW? (MAY BE MORE THAN ONE ANSWER)

                   Variable CP1 can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears  
                   in this public use file.  For example, if the interviewee selected responses 
                   A, C, and F from the list, CP1 will have the value ACF.  If the       
                   interviewee selected D and E, CP1 will have the value DE.  Use the key
                   below to correctly interpret these values.

                   Variable KSR39 can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears  
                   in this public use file.  For example, if the interviewee selected responses 
                   A, C, and F from the list, KSR39 will have the value ACF.  If the       
                   interviewee selected D and E, KSR39 will have the value DE.  Use the key

KSR48              From what institution was the source of that assistance?

                   Variable KSR48 can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears  
                   in this public use file.  For example, if the interviewee selected responses 
                   A, C, and F from the list, KSR48 will have the value ACF.  If the       
                   interviewee selected D and E, KSR48 will have the value DE.  Use the key
                   below to correctly interpret these values.
